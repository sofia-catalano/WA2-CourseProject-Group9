## Instructions to use the application
#### Registration of a user
In order to create a user with username 'USER1' execute those commands:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"username":"USER1","email":"user1@user.com","password":"Passw0rd!"}' -v -i 'http://localhost:8080/user/register' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

In order to activate the user, go in the ACTIVATION table, copy/paste the provisionalId and activationCode in the following command:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"provisionalId":"{provisionalId}","activationCode":"{activationCode}"}' -v -i 'http://localhost:8080/user/validate' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
In order to create an ADMIN with username 'ADMIN' executes those commands:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"username":"ADMIN","email":"admin@user.com","password":"Passw0rd!"}' -v -i 'http://localhost:8080/user/register' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

In order to activate the user, go in the ACTIVATION table, copy/paste the provisionalId and activationCode in the following command:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"provisionalId":"{provisionalId}","activationCode":"{activationCode}"}' -v -i 'http://localhost:8080/user/validate' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
Now set in the DB the Role of this user equal to 1 in order to obtain the ADMIN privilege

In order to log in the user, execute the following command:
```
curl -X POST -d '{"username":"USER1","password":"Passw0rd!"}' -v -i 'http://localhost:8080/user/login' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

When the login is done, a JWT valid for the next hour is obtained in order to be able to later contact the TravelerService, specifying the JWT as a value of the Authorisation http header, like the following one:
```

```

Now use this token to perform actions in 8081 microservice:

- GET "/my/profile":
```
curl --request GET -H "Authorization: {Bearer...}" -v -i  http://localhost:8081/my/profile
```
- PUT "/my/profile"
```
 curl --request PUT -H "Authorization: {Bearer...}" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"name":"Mario","surname":"Rossi","address":"via dei test Torino","date_of_birth":"01/01/1990","telephone_number":"1231231231"}' -v -i  http://localhost:8081/my/profile
```
- GET "/my/tickets"
```
curl --request GET -H "Authorization: {Bearer...}" -v -i  http://localhost:8081/my/tickets
```
- POST "/my/tickets"
```
